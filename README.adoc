= Use any maven variable in an annotation

Steps

1. configure templating-maven-plugin (see pom.xml)
2. add constants in src/main/java/java-templates (see org.tomitribe.Version)
3. use it (see org.tomitribe.UsingIt)

While constants are resolved at compilation time you can use them in annotation
and since the filtering (maven-java link) is done before sources are compiled with templating-maven-plugin
all works smoothly.
